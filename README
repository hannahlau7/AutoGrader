Instructions:
	Place JUnit inside JUnit folder. Make sure the name of the JUnit
	matches what is inside AutoGrader.java.

	Place resources such as interfaces or other java files inside the
	Resource folder.

	Place all student folders (unzipped) into the Student folder.

	To run the AutoGrader, just type ./Run in terminal. 


The following items are hardcoded in AutoGrader.java:
	Name of the JUnit file.
	
	Cutoff score for a good grade. (Should usually be around 75 to 80).


The following items may be changed as necessary:
	Comments generated in AutoGrader.java. 
	
	checkstyle.xml that mandates what is to be flagged as an style error. 


Notes:
	2>&- 1>&- suppresses outputs while running the bash script. Comment 
	these out to debug. 

	Using import org.junit.*; and the @Test annotation will cause problems
	when compiling the JUnit from command line. Manually import each class
	instead.


Issues:
	The System.exit(0) in AutoGrader.java may cause problems if there 
	are tests that take too long to run. See to this in the future.

	Since JUnit tests are run with JUnitCore's run(), @Test (timeout=#) 
	does not work.

	Sometimes the autograder gives students 0's for no good reason. :(

	Feedback is very uniform and appears to be auto-generated.
